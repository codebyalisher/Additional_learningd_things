## 1st-Approach and better to give the prompt to the ai models
```python

I want to implement a new feature in my project using SQLAlchemy and FastAPI/Flask.

üîß Feature Name: [Insert your feature, e.g., "User Authentication", "Inventory System", "Order Management"]

üéØ Objective: [Explain the goal in a sentence, e.g., "Securely manage user accounts", "Track stock changes in real time"]

---

üß± Generate a **complete strategy and modular execution plan** using the following advanced SQLAlchemy and validation practices:

### 1. Engine Setup & Connection Pooling
- Use best practices for setting up SQLAlchemy engine
- Configure connection pooling (size, timeout, recycle)
- Async/Sync settings depending on the use case

### 2. Declarative Models
- Use SQLAlchemy Declarative Base with proper type hints
- Add constraints, indexes, uniqueness, nullable, and default values
- Use enums where applicable
- Optimize `__init__` and `__repr__` for clean data construction

### 3. Pydantic Models (Schemas)
- Define request/response schemas using Pydantic
- Use:
  - Generic types (`List[Model]`, `Optional`, etc.)
  - Validation with `Field`, `validator`, `root_validator`
  - Param types (`Body`, `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, `Cookie`)
  - Nesting, inheritance, and custom validations
  - `Config` and `schema_extra` for OpenAPI hints
  - Enum integration
- Discuss reusable generic schemas for consistency

### 4. Session Management
- Use context managers for managing sync or async sessions
- Separate session logic from model logic
- Discuss scoped/session-local best practices

### 5. Relationships & Associations
- Show how to build one-to-many, many-to-many relationships with `back_populates`
- Use `lazy`, `selectinload`, `joinedload` appropriately
- Use association tables or objects for complex links

### 6. API Layer & Business Logic
- Clearly separate API, service, and database logic
- Discuss:
  - What data is accepted
  - What logic is applied and where
  - Any validation or edge case handling at API level
- Show best practice for helper utilities:  
  - Define inside route or utils, not hardcoded
  - Use dependency injection if needed

### 7. Design Patterns
- Apply Repository,Query Object Pattern, Unit of Work, and Data Mapper where applicable
- Use Lazy Loading, Query Objects for abstraction

### 8. Query Optimization
- Explain best practices:
  - Joins vs subqueries
  - Index usage
  - Eager vs lazy loading
  - Caching layers (Redis or in-memory)

### 9. Security Considerations
- Handle:
  - Password hashing (e.g., `bcrypt`)
  - SQL injection prevention
  - PII/sensitive data encryption or masking
  - Secure headers or input filtering

### 10. Isolation Levels & Concurrency
- Use appropriate transaction isolation levels
- Discuss race condition prevention
- Add row-level locking if necessary (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)

### 11. Async Support
- If using async:
  - Show async engine/session setup
  - Async-friendly CRUD operations
  - Avoid blocking calls in coroutines

### 12. Migrations
- Use Alembic:
  - Setup, revision, and auto-generation
  - Use `env.py` for proper import paths
  - Handle downgrade/upgrade workflows

### 13. Testing Strategy
- Unit testing with:
  - Pytest + fixtures
  - DB mocking or test containers
  - Transaction rollbacks between tests
- Integration testing of APIs

### 14. Integration Layer (FastAPI or Flask)
- Use routers, tags, dependencies, middlewares
- Declare response_model using schemas or ORM models
- Explain serialization strategies for nested relationships

### 15. Scaling & Performance Monitoring
- Support:
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Read replicas
  - Redis caching
- Use profiling, query plans, and N+1 query detection tools (e.g., `sqltap`, `sqlalchemy-profiler`)

üîç Notes:
- Avoid hardcoding values or logic
- Apply DRY and modular principles
- Optimize queries & session usage
- Apply validation at multiple layers (Model ‚Üí Pydantic ‚Üí API)
- Add tips for edge cases or known pitfalls
-provide the general helper function which free the memory as user leave the product

üì¶ Output Format:
- Sequential modular steps
- Clear explanation for each step
- Code snippets where useful
- Tips and gotchas to avoid
```

Edit
I want to implement a new feature in my project using SQLAlchemy.

üîß Feature Name: [Insert your feature, e.g., "User Authentication" or "Product Catalog"]

üéØ Objective: [Briefly explain the goal, e.g., "Create, retrieve, update, and delete users securely"]

Generate a complete strategy and modular execution plan using the following advanced SQLAlchemy practices:

1. Engine Setup & Connection Pooling
2. Declarative Model (with typing and indexes)
3. Session Management (sync/async, context managers)
4. Relationships & Associations (if needed)
5. Design Patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, Data Mapper, Lazy Loading, Query Object)
6. Query Optimization (loading strategies, joins, indexing, caching)
7. Security Considerations (password hashing, SQL injection, sensitive data handling)
8. Isolation Levels & Concurrency Control
9. Async Support (async engine, session, async CRUD, event loop rules)
10. Migrations with Alembic
11. Testing (unit tests, fixtures, mocking, transactional isolation)
12. Integration Strategy (FastAPI or Flask specifics)
13. Scaling Strategies (sharding, read replicas, Redis caching)
14. Performance Monitoring (profiling, N+1 detection, query plans)
15. Any other best practices relevant to this feature

Return the result as:
- Sequential modular steps
- Explanation for each step
- Code snippets where needed
- Tips and gotchas to avoid


Prompt:
 1- at model level: or db level to validate data stored in database. do optimized init.
‚ë° At pydantic level: Types, (Generic Types, meta data annotations, Type hint, Param classes like body, path, query, header, cookie etc, use or define Pyrdatic if they have more data, also apply custom validation, built in lookup, pydantic models (nested, inherited, list of models, Models as generic Type), apply extra validation using these classes params ad using field along with the extra kwargs and generic Types inside model. Schema can also be used inside model using model-config ad we can also add schemes to these Params classes as well.response-model can be db obj, dict or schema . Enums are also can be used.
‚ë¢ API level or business logic:

At this level, We determine what data we will get and what type of it will be, we apply validation or parsing etc .using manual handling or schema.

If we are using helper functions then we also make sure what type of data will be passed, what logic is being applied in that helper function and how it handling the data using edge cases or other way.

We can also define helper functions directly inside end point, similar in our sqlAlchemy model if needed.

or we can define in utils and then can be called them inside end point. Also see dependency if
needed.

Notes: Don't do hard code code, optimized query, proper efficient handle session management.
