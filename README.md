I want to implement a new feature in my project using SQLAlchemy.

ðŸ”§ Feature Name: [Insert your feature, e.g., "User Authentication" or "Product Catalog"]

ðŸŽ¯ Objective: [Briefly explain the goal, e.g., "Create, retrieve, update, and delete users securely"]

Generate a complete strategy and modular execution plan using the following advanced SQLAlchemy practices:

1. Engine Setup & Connection Pooling
2. Declarative Model (with typing and indexes)
3. Session Management (sync/async, context managers)
4. Relationships & Associations (if needed)
5. Design Patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, Data Mapper, Lazy Loading, Query Object)
6. Query Optimization (loading strategies, joins, indexing, caching)
7. Security Considerations (password hashing, SQL injection, sensitive data handling)
8. Isolation Levels & Concurrency Control
9. Async Support (async engine, session, async CRUD, event loop rules)
10. Migrations with Alembic
11. Testing (unit tests, fixtures, mocking, transactional isolation)
12. Integration Strategy (FastAPI or Flask specifics)
13. Scaling Strategies (sharding, read replicas, Redis caching)
14. Performance Monitoring (profiling, N+1 detection, query plans)
15. Any other best practices relevant to this feature

Return the result as:
- Sequential modular steps
- Explanation for each step
- Code snippets where needed
- Tips and gotchas to avoid


Prompt:
 1- at model level: or db level to validate data stored in database. do optimized init.
â‘¡ At pydantic level: Types, (Generic Types, meta data annotations, Type hint, Param classes like body, path, query, header, cookie etc, use or define Pyrdatic if they have more data, also apply custom validation, built in lookup, pydantic models (nested, inherited, list of models, Models as generic Type), apply extra validation using these classes params ad using field along with the extra kwargs and generic Types inside model. Schema can also be used inside model using model-config ad we can also add schemes to these Params classes as well.response-model can be db obj, dict or schema . Enums are also can be used.
â‘¢ API level or business logic:

At this level, We determine what data we will get and what type of it will be, we apply validation or parsing etc .using manual handling or schema.

If we are using helper functions then we also make sure what type of data will be passed, what logic is being applied in that helper function and how it handling the data using edge cases or other way.

We can also define helper functions directly inside end point, similar in our sqlAlchemy model if needed.

or we can define in utils and then can be called them inside end point. Also see dependency if
needed.

Notes: Don't do hard code code, optimized query, proper efficient handle session management.
